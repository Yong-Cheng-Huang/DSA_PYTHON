    "\n",
    "Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm hat works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The insertion_sort function takes an array arr as input. It first calculates the length of the array (n). If the length is 0 or 1, the function returns immediately as an array with 0 or 1 element is considered already sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For arrays with more than one element. We start with second element of the array as first element in the array is assumed to be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare second element with the first element and check if the second element is smaller then swap them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Move to the third element and compare it with the first two elements and put at its correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Repeat until the entire array is sorted.\n",
